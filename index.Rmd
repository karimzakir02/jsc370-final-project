## Introduction to the Project

Reading the news, whether in print or digital forms, has become a daily ritual for over 3 billion people [@admin_2019]. The wide variety of news outlets help us stay up-to-date with the current events and provide us with a significant outlook on today's issues and the world in general. To provide its readers with the most accurate outlook, the news should be reported as neutrally as possible, ensuring that no bias occurs in the reporting. As the news has grown to be a global practice, however, certain news outlets have started to prioritize profit over accuracy. This priority fundamentally changed how the news was reported in multiple ways. A primary example of this is how headlines started to become more sensationalized and generally more negative, in order to exploit a reader's negativity bias and push them to click on a particular article, driving engagement. 

Another way the news attempts to increase their profit is through targeting specific demographics of people by aligning themselves with specific political beliefs. The two most famous examples of this are CNN and Fox News. CNN is considered to strongly align with the Democratic Party of the United States, while Fox News aligns more closely aligns with the Republican Party. These political beliefs strongly influence how these news outlets report on different topics, and even what specific topics they report on, possibly skewing the world perception of its respective audiences. 

A newspaper that could possibly align themselves politically is the New York Times. Based in New York, the newspaper is one of the biggest news outlets in the world. It is considered to be a trustworthy source and is read by a large population. However, does the New York Times and its writers let their political beliefs influence how they write their articles?

TODO: maybe specify the party? Or should it come in the scraping / data acquisition section. Think this should be in the data acquisition section. 

In particular, does the NYT change how they write their headlines based on the party of the current United States president? How does this trend change across multiple reading sections? Do NYT writers include more negative words in their headlines when the president of the U.S. belongs to a Democratic or Republican party? Similarly, when do news outlets use more positive words in their headlines? How does this usage change across the newspaper's reading sections? I chose to focus on the headlines of these articles, since those are the first pieces of the articles that the reader sees, so the reader's first impressions of the article are based on the headlines.

The dataset I will be using to answer these questions contains the headlines of all of the NYT articles written between 2012 and 2019 (inclusive), as well as other information, like their publication date, section name, and abstract.
