## Impact of U.S. Politics on New York Times Headlines - Project Description

This project looks at the impact of U.S. Politics on the New York Times headlines. Specifically, do NYT writers write their headlines differently depending on which party the current U.S. president belongs to? For instance, do NYT writers use more negative words when the president is a member of the Democratic or the Republican party? This allows us to see if NYT writers are perhaps biased towards a specific political party and change how they report the news, by investigating if they use more positive and/or negative words in their headlines during two different time periods.
